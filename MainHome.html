                <p>  once upon a time there lived a king called Lion in a jungle.He fell that he is one who is the strong among all the animals in the jungle.
     lion always used to sleep.and also there lived a small rat which is always used to play on the lion back when it is used to sleep.one day 
     a hunter entered the jungle he kept a net on the lion. so lion is not able to cut the net and live.and also is very harsh towards the rat.
     but rat neverfelt that he is always bad to him.but rat always loved the lion. at that time rat only saved the lion.at that time lion released
     that we should not be always harsh to everyone.and also if we help others they will help us in return.so always be good towards everyone.</p>
